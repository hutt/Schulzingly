# First time using a Ghost theme?

Ghost uses a simple templating language called [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) for its themes.

We've documented our default theme pretty heavily so that it should be fairly easy to work out what's going on just by reading the code and the comments. Once you feel comfortable with how everything works, we also have full [theme API documentation](https://themes.ghost.org) which explains every possible Handlebars helper and template.

**The main files are:**

- `default.hbs` - The main template file
- `home.hbs` - Used for the home page
- `index.hbs` - Used for the blog page
- `post.hbs` - Used for individual posts
- `page.hbs` - Used for individual pages
- `tag.hbs` - Used for tag archives

One neat trick is that you can also create custom one-off templates just by adding the slug of a page to a template file. For example:

- `page-about.hbs` - Custom template for the `/about/` page
- `tag-news.hbs` - Custom template for `/tag/news/` archive

# Routes

This website offers a onepager homepage as well as a blog. You'll need to update your routes in order to make the homepage work.

This is the content of the [routes.yaml file](routes.yaml):
```yaml
routes:
  /: 
    template: page
    data: page.start
  /en/:
    template: page
    data: page.start-en

collections:
  /blog/:
    permalink: /blog/{slug}/
    template: home
    filter: 'tag:-hash-en+tag:-hash-pressemitteilung'
  /en/blog/:
    permalink: /en/blog/{slug}/
    template: home
    filter: 'tag:hash-en+tag:-hash-pressemitteilung'
  /presse/mitteilungen/:
    permalink: /presse/mitteilungen/{slug}/
    template: index
    filter: 'tag:hash-pressemitteilung'

taxonomies:
  tag: /tag/{slug}/
  author: /autor_in/{slug}/
```

# Multi-language support

As you can see in the routes file, this theme supports posts and pages in multiple languages. 

## Posting in another language

If you usually blog in German, but you want to publish a post in English, simply tag the post with the internal tag `#en`. Posts with this internal tag won't be displayed in the posts archive on `yourdomain.tld/blog/`, but under `yourdomain.tld/en/blog/`.

## Pages in another language

To publish a page in another language, simply note its slug and create an additional route in the `routes.yaml` file. The example above features an additional homepage in English. While the German home page's slug is `start`, the english page's slug is `start-en`. It will then be displayed under `yourdomain.tld/en/`. It's as easy as that.

# Development

Source styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# run development server
yarn dev
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.

The `zip` Gulp task packages the theme files into `dist/<theme-name>.zip`, which you can then upload to your site.

```bash
# create .zip file
yarn zip
```

# PostCSS Features Used

- Autoprefixer - Don't worry about writing browser prefixes of any kind, it's all done automatically with support for the latest 2 major versions of every browser.


# SVG Icons

Source uses inline SVG icons, included via Handlebars partials. You can find all icons inside `/partials/icons`. To use an icon just include the name of the relevant file, eg. To include the SVG icon in `/partials/icons/rss.hbs` - use `{{> "icons/rss"}}`.

You can add your own SVG icons in the same manner.
